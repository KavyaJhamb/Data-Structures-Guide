# Data Structure Guide ðŸ“š

This repository contains a comprehensive guide to fundamental data structures and algorithms, aimed at providing clear, well-documented code implementations and explanations. It covers essential topics such as **Arrays**, **Linked Lists**, **Searching Algorithms**, and **Sorting Algorithms** in both **C** and **Python**.

## ðŸš€ Topics Covered:
1. **Arrays**: Learn the basics of array operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.
2. **Linked Lists**: Explore the differences between singly and doubly linked lists, along with operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
3. **Searching Algorithms**: Implement fundamental search algorithms, including linear and binary search.
4. **Sorting Algorithms**: Understand and implement common sorting techniques such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort.

## ðŸ›  Code Implementations:
The code is organized in a clear, step-by-step manner with comments to make the logic easy to follow.
